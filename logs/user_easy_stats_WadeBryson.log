2023-05-17 18:47:02,118 Correlation requires Python version 3.10 or greater.
2023-05-17 18:47:02,118 Your version is 3.11
2023-05-17 18:47:02,118 Here's some time series data:
2023-05-17 18:47:02,118 xtimes:[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
2023-05-17 18:47:02,118 yvalues:[0, 15, 22, 34, 45, 46, 50, 59, 69, 71, 90]
2023-05-17 18:47:02,118 correlation between xtimes and xtimes = 1.00
2023-05-17 18:47:02,118 correlation between xtimes and yvalues = 0.99
2023-05-17 18:47:02,118 Here's some bivariant data (2 variables, together):
2023-05-17 18:47:02,118 x:[4, 0, 6, 2, 10, 8, 5, 1]
2023-05-17 18:47:02,118 y:[40, 28, 54, 36, 72, 61, 48, 30]
2023-05-17 18:47:02,118 Calculate the slope and intercept of a best fit straight line:
2023-05-17 18:47:02,118    slope = 4.45
2023-05-17 18:47:02,118    intercept = 26.12
2023-05-17 18:47:02,118 Let's use our best fit line to PREDICT a future value.
2023-05-17 18:47:02,118    At future x = 200,
2023-05-17 18:47:02,118    we predict the value of y will be 915.
2023-05-17 18:47:02,123 How'd we do? Does this make sense given the data?
2023-05-17 18:47:02,123 Remember to close the app. Control c (or d or z maybe) to close it.
2023-05-17 18:47:02,123 ready_for_chart = True
2023-05-17 18:47:43,831 Done with the chart.
